## üéØ Introduction

This project aims to create a system that automatically adjusts LED brightness based on distance measurements from ultrasonic sensors and ambient light levels from a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). Data is logged and monitored using the Firebase Firestore, allowing for efficient data tracking and analysis.

## üåü Features

- **Dynamic LED Control:** Adjusts LED brightness based on distance measurements from ultrasonic sensors.
- **Ambient Light Sensing:** Incorporates an LDR to adjust LED brightness based on ambient light levels.
- **Real-Time Data Logging:** Uses Firebase Firestore to log sensor data for further analysis and monitoring.
- **Time Synchronization:** Synchronizes time using an NTP client for accurate data logging.
- **Error Handling:** Detects sensor malfunctions and logs errors appropriately.

## üõ† Components and Hardware

The following components are required to set up the Smart LED Control System:

- 1 x [ATmega328P or Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3)
- 1 x [ESP8266 or NodeMCU](https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html)
- 3 x [Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569)
- 1 x [LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9088)
- 3 x [LEDs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14575)
- 3 x [Resistors (220Œ© for LEDs)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14490)
- 1 x [Breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12002)
- Jumper wires and USB cables

## üñ• Software Setup

To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [Firebase ESP Client Library](https://github.com/mobizt/Firebase-ESP-Client)
- [NewPing Library](https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-new-ping/wiki/Home)
- [NTPClient Library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient)

## üöÄ Installation and Configuration

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartLEDControlSystem.git
    cd SmartLEDControlSystem
    ```

2. **Configure Wi-Fi and Firebase**

    Update your Wi-Fi credentials and Firebase configuration in the `ESP8266` code.

    ```cpp
    #define WIFI_SSID "Your_WiFi_SSID"
    #define WIFI_PASSWORD "Your_WiFi_Password"
    #define API_KEY "Your_Firebase_API_Key"
    #define FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID "Your_Firebase_Project_ID"
    #define USER_EMAIL "Your_Firebase_User_Email"
    #define USER_PASSWORD "Your_Firebase_User_Password"
    ```

3. **Upload Code to ATmega328P and ESP8266**

    - Open the `ATmega` folder in Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port, and upload the code.
    - Open the `ESP8266` folder, select the ESP8266 board and port, and upload the code.

4. **Assemble the Circuit**

    Connect the components according to the circuit diagram provided in the `docs` folder.

## üìå Usage

- **Power on the system** and ensure that both ATmega328P and ESP8266 are connected to the internet.
- The system will automatically adjust LED brightness based on sensor readings.
- Data is logged to Firebase Firestore and can be monitored via the Firebase console.

## üîß Future Enhancements

- **Integration with a mobile app:** To allow users to monitor and control the system remotely.
- **Advanced data analytics:** Implement predictive models to anticipate lighting needs based on historical data.
- **Voice control:** Integration with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.
